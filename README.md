# Resume-Filtering

This is a Machine Learning project.
Here, CSV file contains Resume's of different candidates and we have to make a model to select the best candidate of all.
In this code we have shown top 10 candidates to further move into interviewing round.
We have also used the Linear Regression model and got the perfect r2_score.
